Why Amazon?

Amazon is one of the biggest tech companies in the world. To me, Amazon means the most advanced technologies, especially AWS, a group of talented engineers who doesn't afraid of challenges and they are always willing to make innavations. 
I really want to join AWS IoT device software team. It is very appealing to see what you can do with the AWS IoT devices. It would be great if I can be part of it. I am excited to help customer to build the product they need.
And I am also a frontend developer who doesn't panic about new features and issues and able deliver features on time. So I think I can make contribution to Amazon.
